Nextiva doesn’t offer a public OAuth2/REST like RingCentral. The practical way people integrate is through BroadWorks XSI Actions/Events (Nextiva is BroadWorks-based). That uses HTTP Basic Auth (username/password) against an XSP host such as https://cp.nextiva.com and returns XML call logs (missed/received/dialed). Example evidence: third-party integrators describe polling “Nextiva’s XSI API” and show the cp.nextiva.com/com.broadsoft.xsi-actions/... endpoints, which are standard BroadWorks XSI Actions URLs.

What this means for your app (MVP-ready path)

Connection model

No OAuth screen. Ask the user for:

XSP host (often cp.nextiva.com, cp1.nextiva.com, or cp2.nextiva.com)

User ID (their Nextiva/BroadWorks userId, commonly their DID or email)

Password

Store ephemerally for the session (don’t persist) to keep risk low for MVP.

Endpoints you can hit

Missed:
GET https://{xsp}/com.broadsoft.xsi-actions/v2.0/user/{userId}/call-logs/missed

Received:
.../call-logs/received

Placed:
.../call-logs/placed

Optional time filters (server supports query params like startTime/endTime on many BroadWorks deployments).

Response: XML. Convert to JSON on your server and feed your existing pipeline.

(These are the standard BroadWorks XSI “call logs” resources used by many vendors; see BroadWorks XSI references for call-log/ directory access.)

What to ask the customer / Nextiva if it fails

“Please enable XSI-Actions and XSI-Events on our account and ensure our users can reach the XSP host externally (e.g., cp.nextiva.com). We need call-log reads for missed/received/placed calls.”

Some tenants don’t expose XSI externally by default; support can flip it. (Several CRM/CTI tools rely on exactly this.)

Security notes (MVP)

Use TLS only, prompt clearly for credentials, never store them beyond the session, and rotate to a tokenized approach later (e.g., your own short-lived proxy token that holds the Basic creds server-side).

Fallback (no XSI)

If XSI isn’t available, the only universal fallback is admin call-report exports (CDR) from the Nextiva portal (CSV), which are not real-time. That’s fine for demos but not your “live” value prop.

How to add “Nextiva” to your selector today

In your provider switch, add a Nextiva connector that:

Renders a form (XSP host, userId, password).

Calls your server route /providers/nextiva/call-logs?range=last_30_days.

Server route:

Builds the three URLs (missed/received/placed).

Sends with Basic Auth.

Parses XML → JSON → normalizes to your callLog[] shape.

Returns combined list for your revenue math.
