1. The Problem

Small businesses don’t fail because they can’t sell.
They fail because they can’t see.

Every missed call. Every stalled lead. Every untracked voicemail.
That’s lost money, lost momentum, lost growth.

Across 1.3 million home-service businesses in America, over 30 billion dollars disappear every year.
Bottlnekk brings that loss to light before it kills the business.

2. The Solution

Bottlnekk is an AI system that finds and measures where money leaks out of a business.
It starts with phone systems like RingCentral and Zoom.

We scan 30 days of call data and show the exact value of missed or delayed calls.
Then our partner, Hexona Systems, deploys automation that recovers that revenue.

See the leak. Fix the leak. Protect the flow.

3. Proof

The technology behind Bottlnekk has already recovered millions.

Tire Boss cut missed calls from 35% to 2% and grew sales from $50K to $65K.
WealthIO Daycare reduced response time by 81% and doubled ad performance.

What once required full automation teams now happens in minutes through Bottlnekk.

4. The Opportunity

There are 1.3 million home-service businesses in the United States.
Each loses between $25,000 and $100,000 every year to inefficiency.

That’s a $30 billion opportunity waiting to be reclaimed.
Bottlnekk makes every dollar traceable and every leak visible.

5. What We’re Building

We’re partnering with agencies, automation firms, and early adopters to bring this system to every home-service business.

Next, we’re expanding Bottlnekk to analyze CRM and workflow data, giving business owners full visibility across their operations.

Bottlnekk is the diagnostic layer of modern business.
It exposes what’s hidden, repairs what’s broken, and restores what’s possible.

6. The Vision

We start with revenue leaks.
Then we move to workflow leaks.
Soon, Bottlnekk becomes the operating system for business performance.

A single platform that tracks every call, task, and dollar and helps teams move faster, cleaner, and smarter.
