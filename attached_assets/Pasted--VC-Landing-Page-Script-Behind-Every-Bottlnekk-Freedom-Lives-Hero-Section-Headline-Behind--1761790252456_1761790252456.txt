1️⃣ The Hook — The Invisible Drain

Every home-service business thinks they have a sales problem.
In reality, they have a visibility problem.

Every missed call. Every stalled lead. Every untracked voicemail.
That’s revenue slipping through the cracks — silently, every single day.

Across 1.3 million home-service businesses in the U.S., those cracks add up to over $30 billion a year in lost opportunity.

Bottlnekk was built to expose that — before it kills their growth.

2️⃣ The Solution — The Diagnostic Engine

Bottlnekk is the first AI-powered diagnostic platform that detects and quantifies where small businesses are losing money — starting with their phones.

It connects directly to systems like RingCentral and Zoom Phone, analyzes 30 days of real call data, and instantly shows how much revenue was lost to missed or delayed calls.

Then — using automation infrastructure built by our fulfillment partner, Hexona Systems — we deploy AI-powered fixes that recover that lost revenue automatically.

Diagnose the leak.
Automate the fix.
Protect the flow.

3️⃣ Traction — Proof That It Works

Bottlnekk isn’t theory — it’s built on a battle-tested backend.

Our fulfillment engine, powered by Hexona Systems, has already recovered millions in lost revenue for small businesses using the same automation architecture behind Bottlnekk.

Case Studies:

🧰 Tire Boss (Automotive) → Missed calls dropped 35% → 2%, response time cut from 6 hours → 42 seconds, and monthly sales jumped $50K → $65K (+30%).

🎓 WealthIO Daycare (Education) → “Zara,” an AI appointment setter, cut time-to-first contact by 81%, boosted registrations by 15%, and doubled return on ad spend.

Now we’re taking that proven fulfillment system — and putting it behind a front-end diagnostic experience that every small business can access in minutes.

4️⃣ Market Opportunity — The Unseen $30 Billion

There are over 1.3 million home-service businesses in the U.S. alone — plumbers, roofers, HVAC, dental offices, and more.
Each one loses $25K–$100K a year in missed opportunities they can’t see.

That’s a $30B+ leak hiding in plain sight.

Bottlnekk’s mission is simple:
Make every dollar traceable.
Make every leak visible.
And make every small business unbreakable.

5️⃣ The Ask — What We’re Building Next

Right now, Bottlnekk is partnering with agencies, automation firms, and early adopters to deploy our diagnostic and recovery system across the home-service industry.

We’re preparing to raise a $500K pre-seed round to:

Expand our AI diagnostic engine

Integrate call + CRM analysis layers

Grow our fulfillment capacity and partner network

We’re not another automation company.
We’re the diagnostic layer before automation — the system that shows you what’s broken, before it costs you your business.

6️⃣ The Vision — What Comes After

First, we diagnose revenue leaks.
Next, we diagnose workflow leaks.
Eventually — Bottlnekk becomes the central nervous system for small business optimization.

A platform where every minute, every call, and every dollar is accounted for — automatically.

That’s not just automation.
That’s autonomy.
